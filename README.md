### WHACK 2018

Many people are unaware of how the stock market affects the world around us. This app will help users discover how most items around them are affected by stocks and they can invest in almost anything. On top of stock discovery, this app will also help “predict” the future market based on past history. The front-end will use React-Native for mobile and ReactJS for web. To communicate with the back-end, APIs will be created using Python Flask. Augmented Reality technology will be developed using ViroReact and ARCore. Live identification and classification will be done through a constant stream between the user and the Google Cloud Platform. The stock prediction will be done through deep-learning models which are trained on the Google Cloud Platform.

### WHACK 2018

Many people are unaware of how the stock market affects the world around us. This goal of our app is to help users gain awareness of how everyday items are related to the stock market. On top of stock discovery, this app will also “predict” the future market based on past history. The front-end of our application will use React-Native for mobile and ReactJS for web. To communicate with the back-end, APIs will be created using Python Flask. Augmented Reality technology will be developed using ViroReact and ARCore. Live identification and classification will be done through a constant stream between the user and the Google Cloud Platform. The stock prediction will be done through deep-learning models which are trained on the Google Cloud Platform.
